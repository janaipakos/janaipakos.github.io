title: NYC Media Lab Summit 2015 Impressrions

This past weekend I presented one of 100 tech demonstrations at the 2015 NYC Media Lab Summit. Wearables, virtual reality, augmented reality, machine learning, and artificial intelligence were the major topics covered by the presentations, but the sub-topics of many presentations were more subtle. Anxiety about the future, identity, and state of New York City tech emanated from many demonstrations.


I presented a web application called QuantFlaunt. It is a satirical look at social media and data quantification. The audience response was varied. Here are a few of the more interesting interactions.


"So this has no revenue model?" This was maybe my favorite question of the day. The first reason is that it demonstrated an unsubtlety unique to tech. Several questions I was asked were meant to throw me for a loop, as many guests treated this event as a kind of scouting session, looking to disarm potential employees with real-world scenarios and motives. But the question of profitability demonstrated a sort of obliviousness unique to business: of course this project has a revenue model, albeit one more hidden than a monetary transaction. It's one of attention--the only revenue model in town.


Another guest was interested in the big data aspect of QuantFlaunt. "Would you be able to perform this same metric on a million bits of data?" I'm not sure who this was designed to intimidate, but it's the kind of question that isn't very productive. It's hypothetical, and it's a conversation-ender.


Other than these, the event was hugely entertaining. Most people I spoke with understood the satire, and we spoke about the future of social media and branding. -->
