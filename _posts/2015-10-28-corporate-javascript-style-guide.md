The following is a JavaScript style guide combined from various corporate and enterprise jobs. Many of these guides reference GitHub and Google style guides, and they vacillate between cold, hard, practicality and somewhat modern. The three important characteristics of good code is readability, security, and consistency. While some features are appreiated, others are overly uptight.


- Limit line length to 120 characters
- Use double-quotes over single-quotes. This helps the Java developers read your (otherwise indecipherable) code.
- Use /* for comments, and favor block comments over single-line.
- Spaces over tabs, with 4-space indentation for readability
- use JShint to test for errors in code
- Delete commented out code and outdated comments.
- Interestingly, all of these guides define JavaScript as a front-end language that does not interact with the database or interfaces.

This is just a short look into how big old school businesses like to structure their code. Like their business in general, their style guide favors structural order and is risk averse. Semi-colons everywhere, and readability in structure instead of taking risks or attempting to modernize. A great example of aligning business practice with coding practice.
