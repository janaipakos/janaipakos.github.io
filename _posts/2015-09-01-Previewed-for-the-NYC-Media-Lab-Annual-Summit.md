Justin Hendrix listed a sample of projects for the NYC Media Lab's upcoming Annual Summit, and my project, [QuantFlaunt](https://quantflaunt.github.io), was one of them.

He writes:


The proliferation of shared personal data across social media and the growing desire by some to quantify activities, interests and other aspects of life is an intersection ripe for experiment. James Anaipakos’s QuantFlaunt is a project to record and analyze user-submitted metrics, moods, and ideologies in order to explore the idea of curated social identity. The goal is “to bring attention to the free labor — both conscious and unconscious — of social media and user-tracking devices and to let users easily represent themselves through an aggregated identity number — the desired result of branding without hours or weeks of curation,” says Anaipakos.
