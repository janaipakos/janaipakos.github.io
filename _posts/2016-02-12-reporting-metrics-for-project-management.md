title: Reporting Metrics for Project Management

I've recently moved to a position with more management responsibility and reporting expectations. This means less email confirmations and more detailed explanations of project status. One of the challenges with this type of reporting is the presentation of information that has to be distilled but also robust. Charts colored green or red are the name of the game here, and while this is valuable for executives to quickly understand a workstream's status, this single summation is not so valuable for on the ground tracking. *Agile Metrics* and *Software Development Metrics* from Manning are both insanely helpful for project tracking and presentation. The key insight is metrics can be helpful or arbitrary depending on the team leaders methodology. Below are a few of the models I've found most useful for day to day tracking and for stakeholder updates.


- Burn Charts–For linear and iterative processes, burn charts determine if the team is likely to meet the target. The straightforward metric measures the amount of effort by the team, the amount of work needed to finish, and completion rate of the team. We use burn charts for waterfall projects, but they are also valuable in agile where the lead is able to look at throughput by iteration. The biggest challenge with measuring effort is that management will want to squeeze out more effort from workers. That doesn't work and leads to burnout.


- Cycle Chart–This measures the consistency of a team's performance by looking at the average time needed to create a single item. Very useful for estimating the amount of work needed for future projects.


- Cumulative Flow–What are the bottlenecks in the project? Found in Kanban, this diagram can show work in progress. This is valuable for displaying current work and how delivery can be sped up. Very useful for calling out a department that is consistenly slow.


A few concluding remarks: remember that new projects, workflows, and systems require a ramp-up time from employees. If you are thinking of introducing framework X, then manage stakeholder expectations and include a lower throughput of work. And lastly, these metrics and reports are conversation starters. They reveal patterns and observations, and should not be taken as concluding remarks.
