          <p>Hi, welcome to the personal website of James Anaipakos. I'm a front-end developer, UI designer, and author in NYC. I sporadically speak in public about the history of software and data quantification, and write about Eastern European technology, open source projects, and social theory. Currently I'm an associate consultant for Capco, where I improve the documentation and workflow of anti-money laundering applications.</p>

         <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p>Working with designers, film theorists, and media archaeologists at Pratt Institute, I write about post-communist hardware and software, data quantification, contemporary technology. </p>

        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>At Capco Digital, I use D3.js to create data visualizations and dependency tools. I also designed QuantFlaunt, a solo project that captures and measures user metrics and activities.</p>

         <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>I focus on design and process automation rather than the latest framework or tool. With a Build First mindset and an emphasis on clean code, I try to develop applications that are scalable and collaboration-friendly.</p>

         <h2>UX Design</h2>
        <p>I've interviewed hundreds of users and clients, and have experience running usability and A/B tests. Before starting a project, I create client personas and outline user journeys to focus and streamline products and applications.</p>
