        <h5><em>December 1, 2013</em></h5>

<p>This essay will focus not only the democratization of videogame creation tools, but also
the shifting presentation of narrative within videogames, fulfilling the ancient desire for storytelling while divorcing players from commercial products and manufactured affectation. I will identify how a combination of the increased availability of user-friendly and free-to-use videogame tools, the current renaissance of interactive fiction, the plasticity of procedurally generated games, and a focal point of world-building facilitates emergent narratives and usher in previously deterred gamers.</p>
<p>Before I identify how games are being played differently, I will first show how their programming has changed. Interactive fiction (IF) creation tools such as Twine, Inform, and Inklewriter conceive traditionally obtuse video game production as more akin to journal or blog posting. Made up of a connected series of text blurbs, these IF programs are free, and free of programming. The removal of cost and skill barriers creates a less intimidating medium for gamers looking to write stories, and writers looking to make video games. Furthermore, previously underrepresented voices can tell their stories: the list of subjects gleaned from a Twine hub of user-uploaded games ranges from identity, alienation, abuse, sexuality, dysphoria, sexual assault, depression, self-discovery, loss, and posthuman dynamics in the cyber-future, to name a few. While interactive fiction has always featured a wide-range of voices (the feminine posthuman voice of the titular character in Galatea comes to mind), the sheer amount of content provided by ease-of-creation is higher than ever. These user-created stories blur territorial borders, and the accessibility in effect creates an atopic space that can exist everywhere. This space of play is “free from work, from necessity, from seriousness, from morality” (Wark 42). While the content provided by these new authorial voices is important, more impressive is the medium facilitating the availability of creation. How these games are programmed (or more specifically, their absence of programming) allows a wider audience. In addition to the ease of use in the creative practice, Twine and similar IF programs encourage casual audience participation through their removal of user-typed parsers and specific vocabulary that traditionally (strictly) guided the player. As such, the engaging and surreal atmosphere in current IF, seen not only in Twine-based games but also exhibited in the slow-burning, David Lynch influenced Kentucky Route Zero, mirrors the user-determined narrative and dreamy, disjointed experience first introduced in the form of asymmetrical rooms and intricate mazes in Adventure, without the traditional use of insular and restrictive parsers. Unsurprisingly, the more accessible the input, the greater and more varied the output.</p>
<p>While IF programs cannot create anything more than the most basic rules, writers instead focus on telling stories. The democratization comes through not only how the game is played and what is deemed important by the player, but also in the creation of the games themselves. IF and the ease-of-creation supplies a refashioning, or what Jay David Bolter calls a remediation, of traditional narrative with current voices (62). (Remediation also explains the resurgences of old genres. One example focused on in this paper is roguelikes.) On the one hand, the freedom from informatics and rules allows writers to make a seemingly limitless number of personal narratives. Using the storylines in Galatea as an example, the character “plays psychoanalyst to the player, like her model ELIZA; in yet another, the player tells her that she is an AI-created agent, and she strangles him; in still another version, a spoof of Internet romances” (Ryan 132). But as I will discuss with the instance of procedurally generated games, the strict, almost oppressive informatics and rules can produce just as engaging a narrative as any interactive fiction, while remaining devoid of a written story. But in both cases, as Marie-Laure Ryan says, “every relevant property is in the invisible code, since the proper development of the narrative depends as much on the knowledge-base of the computer as on the reader’s inferential capabilities” (129). It is this specification in code, which is invisible in interactive fiction and visible as statistics and informatics in roguelikes that allows the player to develop a narrative. (In the case of roguelikes, the calculations utilizing numerical statistics help players determine their decisions and are similar to a list of acceptable words or parsers in traditional IF.) Counter intuitively, it is this static code, which in theory would limit play, that allows differing narratives to take shape.</p>
<p>In keeping with Nelson’s encyclopedic vision of hypertext, the authors using Twine and other IF programs organize complex networks of ideas (Nelson 2). Twine creates a web to help authors visualize and organize the connecting links. With the introduction of these tools and their systems of links, hypertext networks between author and player begin to form. In short, the games created and the method of creation lets anyone (for the most part) partake. But as I will illustrate next, while previously inhibited voices can be expressed in narrative through easy-to-use programs, the strictest of conditions and most punishing of mechanics can also solidify storytelling, like pressure turning carbon into glass, as shown in a subgenre of procedurally generated games, roguelikes.</p>
<p>The roguelike is a genre of procedurally generated games characterized by level randomization and permanent death, and are derived from the fantasy dungeon-crawler Rogue. With a resurgence in not only classically defined roguelikes such as Dungeon Crawl Soup and Ancient Domains of Mystery, but also games with loose roguelike elements, such as the space exploratory FTL and lineage-focused Rogue Legacy, gamers have demonstrated a want for not only challenging mechanics, but a freedom to explore narrative independent from commercial design. With only minimally written storylines, the featured world-building emerges from the mechanics and battle-fought experiences. The common thread between IF and roguelikes is the interactive process generating narrative: “For one thing, the puzzles in a work of interactive fiction function to control the revelation of the narrative . . . the pleasure is in solving them, in learning the secret” (Montfort 3). Roguelikes and IF facilitate the narrative through mechanics and environmental descriptions, even if they are on polar ends of an axis of visible informatics and rules. IF can craft a poignant narrative through the most basic of user interaction, while players of roguelikes consider death and defeat a richer narrator than any author.</p>
<p>This hands-off approach is facilitated by the interplay of two methods of design: emergent design and progressive design. Jesper Juul writes that most computer games are a combination of these two methods of presenting challenges (323). Emergence is a small number of rules that combine and yield large numbers of game variations, which the players then design strategies for dealing with; progressive design has the player perform a predefined set of actions in order to complete the game. These definitions illustrate what makes a game like Everquest, as Juul writes, so addicting: a constantly changing experience with emerging events, combined with progressive quests and obstacles that essentially never end. For the purpose of this paper, I would argue that the progressive design previously found in NPC dialogue and quest bubbles has transferred onto mechanics, into the code. Or as Ryan says, “evoking not only a world through visible text, but also constructing a productive model of this world through computer-language statements that player never gets to see” (128).</p>
<p>The creation of narrative from the perspective of the player exemplifies what Katherine Malibu calls plasticity: “Plasticity designates a much more effective transformative ability . . . not an infinite modability, but a possibility of displacing or transforming the mark or the imprint, of changing determinism in some way” (16). Games seen as complex to learn, such as Civilization and Dwarf Fortress, are daunting on the algorithmic level, with their steep learning curve and necessary player knowledge of informatics. But on another level, these games intimidate players in their freedom of narrative. This is a key distinction that illustrates the necessity of progressive design. Not only is there a multitude of screens, menus, measurements, informatics, which are learnable through hours of tutorials or explanations, the absence of a goal screen or final level, this much wanted freedom of play, can alienate a player.</p>
<p>When the first-person sandbox game Minecraft was initially released, gamers played it as a survival simulator, and much press was spent on surviving the first night. Players begin without any items or defenses, and must create some sort of base or protection from enemies. Most players will dig a hole into the earth or into a cavern, or climb on top of a difficult to reach area, and wait out the night. Maybe they continue to dig, and create a base against this admittedly mindless and not very threatening enemy. But eventually players flex the capabilities within the code, and create their own narrative. The metagame emerges, and players begin to create objects, monoliths, computers inside Minecraft; they look down from grand sky castles and Death Star’s onto the earth they once huddled beneath. The point of this is gamers need some sort of progressive mechanic or motivation. This can be eliciting a response from Galatea, exploring a room or new area, or building an object. But the key difference in play comes from using the facilitating code and provided design to craft individual narratives, compared to following a set path of checkpoints with little room for exploration. The freedom provided in procedurally generated games are representative of the present time, “[promising] the digital, of absolute, impersonal equity and equanimity” (Wark 121). Similar to the accessibility for new players and proliferation of IF, even if the production is more traditional (complex), the frequency of build updates and method of dispersal with procedurally generated games is of a liberal stance in its open-source.</p>
<p>These independently developed games are updated regularly and patched by the developer as per feedback from the community. The roguelike Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM) was first developed by Thomas Biskup in 1994 and continued until 2002. In 2012, a crowd-sourcing campaign resurrected ADOM’s development, and with more than $90,000 raised, it was the most successfully crowd funded roguelike ever. While Biskup does not make his sourcecode public, he regularly releases updated versions of ADOM. These types of games do not exist in a vacuum, but as a territorialized assemblage of developer and player. Conversely, there is a deterritorialization occurring within not only the gamespace, but also through the democratization of game creation. Twine allows games to be shared as a hyperlink the size of a text document, and games such as Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, and Crusader Kings eliminate mandated narrative in favor of emergent storytelling. While the space within games is becoming richer and more dynamic, and the delivery of such games is more accessible, the communities around these niche titles are becoming unified and more clearly defined: the relationship of author and player is as subtle as who emailed or uploaded the game first, in a collaborative experience of refining game builds, and sharing IF just as easily as forwarding a website. A liberated, collective creation and interaction is formed, where “the layman at play becomes, in a collective, a designer of nomadic space” (von Borries 219).</p>
<p>Linear games with set narratives, “on-rails,” feel sluggish and counterfeit by comparison, yet, as Georg Christoph Lichtenberg says, “What most clearly characterizes true freedom and its true employment is its misemployment” (Lichtenberg 220). While players may not always know what they want in a game, limitations in design can help identify what they do not want (It is no coincidence that this line of thinking is so similar to the Occupy movement). Once the player bumps against enough impassable invisible walls, rote gameplay sections, and restricted agency, they will begin to look elsewhere for emergent design and narrative. The theme of free movement and distancing from culture is not unique to only the genres of IF and roguelikes, but it is indicative of the popularity of independently made video games as a whole. Players “wander through the sectors seeking new experiences . . . without the passivity of tourists, but fully aware of the power they have to act upon the world, to transform it, recreate it” (von Borries 220). While frequent build updates can be a form of community collaboration, a refusal to release unfinished products and the sole creation of titles is a decision for artistic control. In the film Indie Game, this refinement of artistic vision can affect realistic obstacles such as shipment deadlines to the point of absurdity, as demonstrated by Phil Fish’s much-delayed and much maligned as vaporware title Fez.</p>
<p>Made up of levels with a structural design inspired by tetrominos, Fez is a 2-D platformer with its platforms arranged in three dimensions. To solve puzzles and move across levels, players must rotate the level 90-degrees. Throughout Fez, there are flourishes of diegesis, extradiegesis, and hypodiegesis, as defined by Nick Montfort (16). (Montfort uses the 1985 IF A Mind Forever Voyaging to define these words: Diegesis occurs within the game, hypodiegesis occurs within a simulated world within the game (the diegesis within diegesis, a layer within the game world), and extradiegesis occurs outside of the game-world, for example narration about the game world, or the game asking if the player needs help solving a puzzle).</p>
<p>A puzzle game at heart, Fez integrates problems that require assistance outside the game. For example, as players collect cubes throughout levels, they will begin to notice cave-drawings and as-yet undecipherable symbols harkening a previous race and civilization. In a level deemed the “Rosetta Stone Room,” the player can open a chest and receive an artifact; this artifact allows the player to read the Rosetta Stone in the room, with the phrase “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” This sentence contains every letter in the alphabet, and as such allows players to decode the other wall-writings. The wall-writings can also take the form of Quick Response Codes (QR Code), a label that can record information related to an item. Player’s must use a cellular phone with somewhat modern technology (a QR reader) to be able to decipher these wall-writings. While these wall-writings of foreign alphabets and QR Code are presented diagetically, within the game-world of Fez, the act of cryptography, documentation, translation, and necessary technology occurs outside of the gamespace as a form of rebellion against traditionally linear videogame production and storytelling. The code in Fez overwhelms the gamespace, mimicking a crash twice—once in the beginning and again at the ending—needs the use of outside resources, and a collaborative community, to solve the most difficult of cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p>A counterpoint is that this emergence through creativity and freedom is a multiplication of the means of control, rather than a breakthrough of the traditional means. Galloway citing Deleuze: “In making freeways you don’t enclose people but instead multiply the means of control . . . people can drive infinitely and ‘freely’ without being at all confined yet while still being perfectly controlled” (Galloway 87-88). In other words, are the means of control simply wider in sandbox games and roguelikes? The structure is still there, of course, but I would argue that in this medium of games, change comes from within and through example. A game that does something different will draw more attention and by proxy shine a light on poor design. As Enzensberger states on the subject of utilizing a medium to enact social change, “Networklike communications models [can] overcome this situation: a mass newspaper, written and distributed by its readers, a video network of politically active groups” (74).</p>
<p>When presented with the freedom to create their own narrative, and utilize extradiegetic means of gaming, gamers can see what is restrictive about traditional system of progression. As Stefano and Harvey write in The Undercommons, “Listening to the cacophony and noise tells us that there is a wild beyond to the structures we inhabit and that inhabit us” (7). As players create their lineage in Dwarf Fortress, plot to usurp the king in Crusader Kings, and attempt to explore deeper the levels in Spelunky, the further they drift from linear, slickly produced big-budget titles. This isn’t to say one genre is better than the other, discredit a gamer’s taste, or deny the pleasure from a tightly-paced commercial narrative. It is simply meant to highlight the emergent exploration of gamespace and structure exhibited by many genres, and the pleasure derived from prolonging encounters and the activity of performance, what James Newman calls detours: “The delaying of the end . . . the gameworld may be seen as a site rich in narrative potential, in which spatial stories may unfold through the transformations enacted by the player” (81).</p>
<p>The example of Fez, neither procedurally generated nor classified as IF, nonetheless demonstrates a common thread in the mentioned genres and games: developers are telling a story and building a world through the medium (sometimes across several) rather than through explicitly told content. The three aforementioned characteristics, creation and dispersal, player and mechanic accessibility, and rich and radical gamespace world-building, all differ to certain degrees: the frequency of new content in IF and roguelikes dwarfs the unique Fez, but the extra-extradiegesis of outside tools needed to solve the QR codes, as well as the community effort to solve the most difficult of puzzles, is specific to Fish’s platformer. Despite a difference in amount with each of the mentioned genres, these three aspects all represent player agency at their most basic level, capturing a zeitgeist of social movement, and set forth a precedent for not only future titles, but open-source platforms as well. One need only look at the success and parroting of Steam. The more available the tools to create games, the more plastic a games mechanics, and the richer a game’s world, the smaller the gap between player and creator.</p>
